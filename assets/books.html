Isaacson delves into the minute aspects of jobs� personal life, his childhood, upbringing and evolution as a professional.  His childhood and personal life are inseparably linked.  Jobs tried to keep his life very simple but the paradox was he was an extremely complex, megalomaniac with an obsession for detail and perfection, and ruthless in his dealings with his colleagues while working on different projects in Apple.Isaacson goes about with an incisive and critical journalistic bent of mind presenting the story as is.  The biography examines Jobs� childhood, his adoption by his working class parents, and his childhood as a precautious child and his tumultuous youthful years as LSD dropping college drop out.  Isaacson successfully attempts to show the inextricable link between Jobs� childhood, the painful fact of abandonment by his biological parents and the bohemian, hippie background on the end product of Jobs as an innovator, entrepreneur and marketer par excellence.</p>
