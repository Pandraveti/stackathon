    <p>Your professors are like a guardian angel for your entire semesters. Go to your professors, teachers or faculty members for clearing doubts. Trust me they would be happy to help you.

    <h3><u>Follow previous year questions:</u></h3>



    <p>Collect the last 10 years or 15 years questions from the library and study the pattern carefully. Somehow you will find a similar pattern of question papers. You can also identify some regular questions which repeat almost every year. Prepare accordingly.</p>



    <h3><u>Take mock tests:</u></h3>



    <p>Once you are done with one section, try to take a self-test. While doing a group study or studying alone, taking a test will help you in exam preparation. If you ask me how to prepare for engineering semester exams, I’d say to take a self-test from previous years question papers. This process will help you to manage your time wisely at the time of the exam and also boost your strength.</p>



    <h3><u>Online study materials:</u></h3>



    <p>There are many topics before the exam you might think that you need assistance with. Sometimes some topics are too hard to understand as well. Going through books won’t help you at the last moment. Better you clear your doubts from professors or get help from the online platform. There is plenty of study material in video format that will help you to understand the topics clearly..</p>



    <h3><u>Track your progress: </u></h3>
